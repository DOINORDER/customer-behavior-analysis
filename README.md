Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Dashboard
📌 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow.
It covers dataset loading, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, visualization, dashboard creation, and report presentation.
The goal is to transform raw data into meaningful insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI, followed by summarizing findings in a report and a presentation.

📂 Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information related to [mention domain: e.g., sales, customers, operations, etc.].

It includes fields such as [list a few example columns].

Data was imported in CSV/Excel format into Python for initial exploration and cleaning.

🛠 Tools & Technologies

🔍 Project Steps
1. Data Loading

Imported the dataset using Pandas.

Verified datatypes, missing values, and structure.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics and distribution analysis

Visualization of trends, patterns, and correlations

Identification of outliers and anomalies

3. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Removing duplicates

Data type corrections

Standardizing text and numerical fields

4. SQL Queries (MySQL / SQL Server)

Loaded cleaned dataset into SQL database

Performed queries such as:

Filtering and sorting

Aggregations

Joins

Group-by analysis

Business-specific insights

5. Dashboard Creation (Power BI)

Imported cleaned dataset

Built an interactive dashboard containing:

KPIs

Charts and graphs

Filters and slicers

Trend analysis

6. Report & Presentation

A detailed summary report created in Power BI

Final presentation made using Gamma, highlighting:

Key insights

Visuals

Recommendations

📊 Results / Insights

Identified key trends and patterns such as:

[Example: monthly sales growth, customer behavior, performance gaps]

Highlighted areas for improvement and potential business opportunities.

Dashboard allows interactive exploration for deeper insights.

▶️ How to Run the Project

Clone the repository:

git clone <repo-link>


Install required Python libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Open the Jupyter Notebook to run Python scripts for data loading, cleaning, and EDA.

Import data into MySQL / SQL Server using the provided SQL file.

Open the Power BI file (.pbix) to view or modify the dashboard.

Check the Reports folder for the Power BI report and Gamma presentation.
